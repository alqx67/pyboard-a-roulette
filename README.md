PyBoard-a-roulette project
==========================

About
-----
Here I'll put some libraries that can be useful for the PyBoard-a-roulette project.

The aim of pyboard-a-roulette is to place wheels on a PyBoard to make it move around.

Installing a library:
---------------------
simply copy the '.py' files listed in the "library" section here under into the root directory of your PYFLASH PyBoard drive.

Once done, you can use the regular python import statement to use the library into your own scripts.

Libraries
----------
All the libraries are stored under the libraries directory which is subdivided depending on the peripherals/sensors you need to handle.

* __r2wheel\hbridge.py__ : Library HBridge for a single H-Bridge (1 motor control) and DualHBridge (2 motors control).
 * Quite good to manage a L293D
 * Both classes contains basic move method (forward, backward, halt) with speed management.
 * DualHBridge already manage path derivation due to the motors not being exactly identicals 
* __r2wheel\r2wheel.py__ : Library Robot2Wheel extending DualHBridge class to control a 2 Wheels robot plateform.
 * Implement turn() method with RIGHT_ROTATE, LEFT_ROTATE, RIGHT_BEND, LEFT_BEND
 * Can switch forward/backward for each motor (manage from code instead of re-wiring the motor)
 * Can switch right/left motor from code (instead of re-wiring the motors)

Samples
-------
This project will be conducted in several steps depending on request, contribution and implemented ideas.
So I do order the sample folder with numerical prefix (2 digits). This numerical order also show the historical steps of the project. 

01-r2wheel-test\    Robot-2-wheel wiring AND test scripts. 
                    Sample scripts used to test the assembled "Robot 2 Wheel" and classes HBridge, Robot2Wheel
